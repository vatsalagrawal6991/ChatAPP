Problem Question

build a real-time chat application that the students can use to communicate and
share reels and memes among their friends ;-). Below is the design requirement of the
chat application:
1. To verify the identity of the student, they should log in using the Kerberos
credentials.
2. The students can chat among themselves.
3. The students can create a chat room to have a group chat.
4. They must not lose their data after logout from the application or a system
shutdown or application crash.
5. The students may share any media file or meme, or reels among their friends.
In this assignment, you are expected to submit the following:
1. Implement a real-time chat application using Node JS. To design the front end,
you can use HTML/CSS and Angular JS or React JS or Ajax calls to manage API
calls to the server from the front end. You can either use Cassandra or MongoDB
to store information.

3. The API details and their implementation details should be documented in the
report.
